     * An access represents the connection between a provider and an account. It enables AHOI to log
     * into a (bank) account on behalf of a user. Setting up an access is relatively simple: A
     * provider id is required, and the credential fields, which are used to access the provider, have
     * to be set. The latter differ among the various providers. For example, for banks, it is common
     * to use the account number and a secret pin. Other providers might use an e-mail address and a
     * password. In a production environment, the pin has to be encrypted. Creating an access also
     * allows AHOI to start interacting with the provider: It starts creating accounts, gathering
     * transactions and classifying them. Deleting an access, on the other hand, also removes all
     * associated information. Furthermore, an access contains important information about its current
     * state â€” for example, whether the account has been locked.
